This is one of my company project. Mainly, I'm working as a backend developer for this project for about 1 and a half years (August 2021 - Early 2023).

I'm responsible for the backend development of the app, including the API, database, deployment, and the integration with the 3rd party (Twilio, SendGrid, Stripe, Sentry, OneSignal).

Stack used in the backend:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Socket.io
- Sequelize
- PostgreSQL
