A voting app used for one of my school task and for practicing React and Node.

This app is having 2 interfaces, one is for the user to vote and the other one is for the admin to manage the candidates and the election.

Stack used:

- React
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- AdminJS (formerly AdminBro)
