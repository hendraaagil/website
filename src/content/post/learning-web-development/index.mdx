# My Journey Learning Web Development

Looking back at my first year of learning web development.

## Where I Started

I knew nothing about HTML, CSS, or JavaScript when I began.

## Key Milestones

1. Built my first static HTML page
2. Learned CSS and made it responsive
3. Discovered JavaScript and interactivity
4. Built my first full-stack project

## Lessons Learned

- Consistency beats intensity
- Build projects, not just tutorials
- Join communities and ask questions
