# TypeScript Best Practices in 2024

TypeScript has become the standard for large-scale JavaScript applications.

## Type Safety Tips

### Use Strict Mode

Always enable strict mode in your tsconfig.json:

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"strict": true
	}
}
```

### Prefer Interfaces for Objects

Use interfaces for object shapes and types for unions and primitives.

### Avoid `any`

The `any` type defeats the purpose of TypeScript. Use `unknown` instead when needed.
