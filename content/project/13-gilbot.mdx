A WhatsApp bot to accompany your loneliness. I made this because have an unused number and I want to make something useful with it. But for now is already inactive because it break the rules of WhatsApp itself. So, I make the source code open source in here:

Then I create a new bot in Telegram with improvement on the deployment to use Docker. The bot is developed using [grammy](https://grammy.dev/) library with same functionality on the WhatsApp before. You can try it at: [t.me/gilchatbot](https://t.me/gilchatbot).
