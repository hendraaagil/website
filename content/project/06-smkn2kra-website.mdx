This website is used for the high school where I studied (SMKN 2 Karanganyar).

I made this before my graduation and by collaborating with my classmates, you can check it out at [https://smkn2kra.sch.id/teams](https://smkn2kra.sch.id/teams). I'm working on the frontend side and my classmates working on the backend, design, also the 3D. I really appreciate and proud of our work.

Stack used:

- Next.js
- Chakra UI
- Laravel (for the backend)
