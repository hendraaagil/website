This is a company project where I am responsible for the entire website development.

The website consists of static pages, along with a list of articles and FAQs that are dynamically fetched from a WordPress CMS. Referral and registrant data are stored in Firestore, while the registration form is managed using the Tally platform, developed by another team.

To handle registrant data, a webhook is triggered upon form submission. This webhook processes the data by storing it in Firestore and sending a confirmation email automatically.

Stack used:

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Firebase (Firestore)
- react.email
