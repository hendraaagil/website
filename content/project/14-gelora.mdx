This is one of my company project. I'm working as a team lead for this project for about 4 months (July 2023 - October 2023).

I'm responsible for identifying all the features to be developed based on the client's needs, managing the developers workload, and deciding on releases / updates for the application. Also, discuss with the client about the API that will be developed.

Stack used in the application:

- React Native
- React Query
- React Hook Form
- TypeScript
- MobX
- i18n
- AppCenter
